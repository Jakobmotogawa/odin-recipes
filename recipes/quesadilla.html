    <h2>What is a Quesadilla?</h2>
    <p>
        A quesadilla is a Mexican dish that consists of a tortilla filled with cheese (and often other ingredients, such as meat and veggies). Itâ€™s cooked on a griddle or stove. Full quesadillas feature cheese sandwiched between two flat tortillas. Half quesadillas, like the one in this recipe, is a single tortilla that has been topped with fillings and folded into a half moon shape.
